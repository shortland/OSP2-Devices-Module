# Statistics

The numbers shown are ranges from the lowest to the highest values for each device.


## Total number of tracks swept on each device

[Total number of cylinders swept]

    DEMO Range:
        - Device 0: 866 - 9389
        - Device 1: 6 - 102
        - Device 2: 5 - 22

    My Implementation Range:
        - Device 0: 866 - 9926
        - Device 1: 6 - 101
        - Device 2: 5 - 19

    Consensus: When comparing the demo to my implementation, the results are very similar. The only notable difference being that my implementation has slightly more track sweeps on device 0.


## Average number of tracks swept per I/O request

[Average number of cylinders swept per disk access]

    DEMO Range:
        - Device 0: 4 - 7
        - Device 1: 1 - 2
        - Device 2: 1

    My Implementation Range:
        - Device 0: 4 - 7
        - Device 1: 1 - 2
        - Device 2: 1 - 2

    Consensus: The average number of sweeps per disk access is very similar. The data doesn't differ enough to draw any conclusion on which is more efficient.


## Average turnaround time for I/O requests

[Service time per I/O request]

    DEMO Range:
        - Device 0: 202 - 744
        - Device 1: 195 - 452 
        - Device 2: 576 - 1307

    My Implementation Range:
        - Device 0: 202 - 671
        - Device 1: 221 - 452
        - Device 2: 576 - 737

    Consensus: Both implementations were very similar, although the demo's device 2 had a much higher maximum service time per I/O request.


## System throughput

[Average service time per thread]

    DEMO Range:
        16663.87 - 30770.156

    My Implementation Range:
        16663.87 - 34494.887

    Consensus: The demo had a slightly lower maximum service time per thread.
